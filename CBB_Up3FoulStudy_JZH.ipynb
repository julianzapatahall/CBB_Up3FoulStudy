        "Interestingly, however, there are more green cells as the time left on the game clock increases. This suggests that fouling earlier may be beneficial. Additionally, when considering this graph alongside the two fouling decision graphs, a pattern emerges. Figure 7 shows that the overtime-adjusted win percentages associated with fouling remain constant between 87% to 93%. Figure 8 shows that the overtime-adjusted win percentages associated with not fouling dip under 80% as the shot clock decreases. Thus, fouling in the cells with a low shot clock (e.g., cell 22 and cell 27), results in the highest competitive benefit. \n"

Moreover, by using a new variable that had not previously been employed and an extensive amount of game data, I have been able to shine light on the most debated question within strategic fouling. Although this set of results should not be applied outside of the scope of NCAA college basketball, a similar project could elevate the level of fouling strategy within the NBA or any other basketball league around the world."
